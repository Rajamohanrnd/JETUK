        <p>Vedic knowledge and culture so preciously preserved for millions of years is being lost in this modern era. We have forgotten the significance and importance of our customs and traditions. </p>
        <p>What is the goal of the human life? What should one realize in this life? What should be oneâ€™s response in our daily chores? Due to the lack of answers to these questions there is confusion in the society, leading to unrest, lack of confidence
            and disrespect for the traditional way of living. </p>
        <p>Prajna, transforming good knowledge into action, is a series of classes conducted for the benefit of children and adults under the guidance of His Holiness Sri Sri Sri Tridandi Chinna Srimannarayana Ramanuja Jeeyar Swamiji. Students will be learning
            about our ancient heritage and will thus develop to love the same.</p>

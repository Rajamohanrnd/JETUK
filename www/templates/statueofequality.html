            <li>Shed your ego. Love the fellow humans.</li>
            <li>What is of supreme importance is purity of mind and deed.</li>
            <li>The conquest of passion and attachment was the solution for the miseries of life.</li>
            <li>Promote the message of peace, love, worship, mutual respect, humility and selfless service to all beings.</li>
